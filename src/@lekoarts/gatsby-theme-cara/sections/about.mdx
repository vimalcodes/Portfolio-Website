# About

Trust One. Trust Oneself. Always. 
<font size="5">
My undergraduate degree has been a striving experience, in which I invested my time in learning various types of simulation, to name a few <strong>ANSYS CFX, CFD and Static Structural</strong>. For thesis, I was curious on implementing simulation to a practical business to find the credibility of the data acquired and in my report I have concluded by stating simulation does play a significant role in determining testing of a condition with reduce cost, time and energy. With that, I ventured into learning Data Analyst and experimenting with Web Development. This current web portofolio showcases all my projects I have done so far. On the side note, I tutor students from undergraduate of Mechanical Engineering, for design project and simulation. Currently, am undertaking Web Development projects that is based on open source and free though limited hosting capabilities.
